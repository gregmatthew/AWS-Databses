270-[DF]-Lab - Selecting Data from a Database
270-[DF]-Lab: Selecting Data from a Database

Overview

This lab focuses on using the SELECT statement and common database operators to query a relational database named world, which contains three tables: city, country, and countrylanguage. The lab demonstrates practical database querying skills using a MySQL database hosted on an AWS Command Host instance.

Scenario

The database operations team has provided a world database. The task is to write SQL queries using the SELECT statement and operators to extract data based on specific use cases.

Objectives

After completing this lab, you will be able to:





Use the SELECT statement to query a database.



Use the COUNT() function.



Apply the following operators: WHERE, ORDER BY, and AND.

Duration

Approximately 45 minutes.

Prerequisites





A Command Host instance with a MySQL database client.



A world database with city, country, and countrylanguage tables.



AWS Management Console access with Session Manager for terminal connections.

Lab Setup

Accessing the AWS Management Console





Start the lab by selecting Start Lab in the AWS Management Console.



Wait for the lab status to show a green circle, indicating readiness.



Open the AWS Management Console in a new browser tab.



Arrange browser tabs to view instructions and the console simultaneously.



Note: Do not change the AWS Region unless instructed.

Task 1: Connect to the Command Host





In the AWS Management Console, navigate to Services > Compute > EC2.



Select Instances from the left navigation menu.



Check the box next to the instance labeled Command Host and choose Connect.



On the Session Manager tab, select Connect to open a terminal window.



Run the following commands to configure the terminal:

sudo su
cd /home/ec2-user/



Connect to the MySQL database using:

mysql -u root --password='re:stÃ¤rt!9'



Tip: If the Session Manager is unresponsive, close the window, reconnect, and rerun the above commands.

Task 2: Query the World Database

In this task, you will query the world database using SELECT statements and various operators.





Show Existing Databases
Verify the world database exists:

SHOW DATABASES;



List All Rows and Columns in the Country Table
Retrieve all data from the country table:

SELECT * FROM world.country;



Count Rows in the Country Table
Use the COUNT() function to count all rows:

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM world.country;



Display Table Schema
View the columns in the country table:

SHOW COLUMNS FROM world.country;



Query Specific Columns
Select specific columns from the country table:

SELECT Name, Capital, Region, SurfaceArea, Population FROM world.country;



Rename Column in Output
Use the AS clause to rename SurfaceArea to Surface Area:

SELECT Name, Capital, Region, SurfaceArea AS "Surface Area", Population FROM world.country;



Order Results by Population (Ascending)
Sort the results by Population in ascending order:

SELECT Name, Capital, Region, SurfaceArea AS "Surface Area", Population FROM world.country ORDER BY Population;



Order Results by Population (Descending)
Sort the results by Population in descending order:

SELECT Name, Capital, Region, SurfaceArea AS "Surface Area", Population FROM world.country ORDER BY Population DESC;



Filter Results with WHERE Clause
List countries with a population greater than 50,000,000, sorted by population in descending order:

SELECT Name, Capital, Region, SurfaceArea AS "Surface Area", Population FROM world.country WHERE Population > 50000000 ORDER BY Population DESC;



Combine Conditions with AND Operator
List countries with a population between 50,000,000 and 100,000,000, sorted by population in descending order:

SELECT Name, Capital, Region, SurfaceArea AS "Surface Area", Population FROM world.country WHERE Population > 50000000 AND Population < 100000000 ORDER BY Population DESC;

Challenge

Query the country table to answer the following question:





Which country in Southern Europe has a population greater than 50,000,000?

Solution:

SELECT Name, Capital, Region, SurfaceArea AS "Surface Area", Population 
FROM world.country 
WHERE Region = 'Southern Europe' AND Population > 50000000;

Conclusion

In this lab, you successfully:





Used the SELECT statement to query the world database.



Applied the COUNT() function to count rows.



Utilized the WHERE, ORDER BY, and AND operators to filter and sort data.
