269-[DF]-Lab - Insert, Update, and Delete Data in a Database
AWS Database Lab: Insert, Update, and Delete Data in a Database

This document outlines a lab completed to demonstrate the use of SQL for inserting, updating, deleting, and importing data in a relational database. The lab uses a MySQL database named world, containing three tables: city, country, and countrylanguage. The lab was conducted in an AWS environment using a Command Host instance with a MySQL client.

Lab Overview and Objectives

Scenario: The database operations team has created a relational database called world. The task is to validate its configuration by performing INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE operations on the country table.

Objectives:





Insert rows into a table.



Update rows in a table.



Delete rows from a table.



Import rows from a database backup file.

Duration: Approximately 45 minutes.

Resources Provided:





Command Host instance with a MySQL client.



world database with city, country, and countrylanguage tables.

Data Source: Sample data from Statistics Finland, general regional statistics, February 4, 2022, licensed under CC BY 4.0.

Lab Setup

Accessing the AWS Management Console





Start the lab from the AWS Management Console.



Wait for the lab status to show a green circle, indicating readiness.



Open the AWS Management Console in a new browser tab and arrange it alongside the lab instructions.

Task 1: Connect to the Database





In the AWS Management Console, navigate to Services > EC2 > Instances.



Select the Command Host instance and connect via Session Manager.



Configure the terminal:

sudo su
cd /home/ec2-user/



Connect to the MySQL database:

mysql -u root --password='re:stärt!9'



List existing databases:

SHOW DATABASES;

Lab Tasks

Task 2: Insert Data into a Table





Verify the country table exists:

SELECT * FROM world.country;



Insert two rows into the country table:

INSERT INTO world.country VALUES ('IRL', 'Ireland', 'Europe', 'British Islands', 70273, 1921, 3775100, 76.8, 75921, 73132, 'Ireland', 'Republic', 1447, 'IE');
INSERT INTO world.country VALUES ('AUS', 'Australia', 'Oceania', 'Australia and New Zealand', 7741220, 1901, 18896000, 79.8, 351182, 392911, 'Australia', 'Constitutional Monarchy', 135, 'AU');



Verify the inserted rows:

SELECT * FROM world.country WHERE Code IN ('IRL', 'AUS');

Output:

Task 3: Update Rows in a Table





Update the Population column to 0 for all rows:

UPDATE world.country SET Population = 0;



Verify the update:

SELECT * FROM world.country;



Update Population and SurfaceArea columns for all rows:

UPDATE world.country SET Population = 100, SurfaceArea = 100;



Verify the update:

SELECT * FROM world.country;

Task 4: Delete Rows from a Table





Delete all rows from the country table:

SET FOREIGN_KEY_CHECKS = 0;
DELETE FROM world.country;



Verify the deletion:

SELECT * FROM world.country;

Task 5: Import Data Using an SQL File





Exit the MySQL terminal:

QUIT;



Verify the presence of the world.sql file:

ls /home/ec2-user/world.sql



Import data from the world.sql file:

mysql -u root --password='re:stärt!9' < /home/ec2-user/world.sql



Reconnect to the database:

mysql -u root --password='re:stärt!9'



Verify the tables:

USE world;
SHOW TABLES;

Expected Output: Tables city, country, and countrylanguage.



Verify data in the country table:

SELECT * FROM world.country;



Query the city and countrylanguage tables:

SELECT * FROM world.city;
SELECT * FROM world.countrylanguage;

Conclusion

This lab successfully demonstrated:





Inserting rows into the country table.



Updating rows in the country table.



Deleting rows from the country table.



Importing data from a SQL backup file.
