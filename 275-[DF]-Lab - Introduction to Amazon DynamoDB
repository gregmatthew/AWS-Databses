275-[DF]-Lab - Introduction to Amazon DynamoDB
Introduction to Amazon DynamoDB Lab
Lab Overview
Amazon DynamoDB is a fast and flexible NoSQL database service designed for applications requiring consistent, single-digit millisecond latency at any scale. It is a fully managed database supporting both document and key-value data models, making it ideal for mobile, web, gaming, ad-tech, Internet of Things (IoT), and other applications.
In this lab, you will:

Create a DynamoDB table to store information about a music library.
Add and modify data in the table.
Query the table using both query and scan operations.
Delete the DynamoDB table.

Duration: Approximately 35 minutes.
Topics Covered

Creating an Amazon DynamoDB table
Entering data into an Amazon DynamoDB table
Querying an Amazon DynamoDB table
Deleting an Amazon DynamoDB table

Prerequisites

Access to the AWS Management Console
Basic understanding of database concepts

Accessing the AWS Management Console

In the lab environment, choose Start Lab at the upper-right corner.
Troubleshooting: If you encounter an "Access Denied" error, close the error box and choose Start Lab again.


Wait for the lab status to indicate readiness:
Red circle: Lab has not started.
Yellow circle: Lab is starting.
Green circle: Lab is ready.


Once the lab is ready, choose the green circle next to AWS to open the AWS Management Console in a new browser tab. You will be automatically signed in.
Tip: If the tab does not open, check for a browser banner or icon indicating blocked pop-ups. Allow pop-ups to proceed.


Arrange the AWS Management Console tab alongside the lab instructions for easy reference.
Important: Do not change the lab Region unless instructed.

Task 1: Create a New Table
In this task, you create a DynamoDB table named Music with a partition key and sort key to uniquely identify items.

In the AWS Management Console, select the Services menu, then under Database, choose DynamoDB.
Choose Create table.
Configure the table:
Table name: Enter Music.
Partition key: Enter Artist (leave as String).
Sort key (optional): Enter Song (leave as String).


Use the default settings for indexes and provisioned capacity.
Scroll down and choose Create table.
Wait for the Music table to become Active (takes less than 1 minute) before proceeding.

Task 2: Add Data
In this task, you add items to the Music table. Each item represents a song with attributes like Artist and Song (required) and optional attributes like Album or Year.
Add First Item

Select the Music table.
Choose Actions > Create item.
Enter required attributes:
Artist: Pink Floyd
Song: Money


Add additional attributes:
Choose Add new attribute > String.
Field: Album, Value: The Dark Side of the Moon.
Choose Add new attribute > Number.
Field: Year, Value: 1973.


Choose Create item to add the item.

Add Second Item

Repeat the process to create a second item with the following attributes:




Attribute Name
Attribute Type
Attribute Value



Artist
String
John Lennon


Song
String
Imagine


Album
String
Imagine


Year
Number
1971


Genre
String
Soft rock


Note: The Genre attribute demonstrates DynamoDB's schema flexibility, as itâ€™s not present in other items.
Add Third Item

Create a third item with the following attributes:




Attribute Name
Attribute Type
Attribute Value



Artist
String
Psy


Song
String
Gangnam Style


Album
String
Psy 6 (Six Rules), Part 1


Year
Number
2011


LengthSeconds
Number
219


Note: The LengthSeconds attribute further showcases DynamoDB's ability to handle varying attributes per item.
Additional Info: For larger datasets, you can load data faster using the AWS CLI, programmatic scripts, or third-party tools.
Task 3: Modify an Existing Item
In this task, you correct an error in the Year attribute for the Psy item.

In the DynamoDB dashboard, under Tables, choose Explore Items.
Select the Music table.
Find and select the item with Artist: Psy.
Change the Year from 2011 to 2012.
Choose Save changes to update the item.

Task 4: Query the Table
In this task, you retrieve data using both query and scan operations.
Query Operation

In the Music table, expand Scan/Query items and choose Query.
Enter:
Artist (Partition key): Psy
Song (Sort key): Gangnam Style


Choose Run to retrieve the item.
Note: Queries are efficient as they use the primary key index.



Scan Operation

Scroll up and choose Scan.
Expand Filters and enter:
Attribute name: Year
Type: Number
Value: 1971


Choose Run to display only the item with Year = 1971.
Note: Scans are less efficient as they examine every item in the table.



Task 5: Delete the Table
In this task, you delete the Music table and all its data.

In the DynamoDB dashboard, under Tables, select Update settings.
Ensure the Music table is selected.
Choose Actions > Delete table.
In the confirmation panel, enter delete and choose Delete table.

Conclusion
You have successfully:

Created an Amazon DynamoDB table
Entered and modified data in the table
Queried the table using query and scan operations
Deleted the DynamoDB table

Ending the Lab

Choose End Lab at the top of the lab page.
Select Yes to confirm.
An "Ended AWS Lab Successfully" message will confirm the lab has ended.
