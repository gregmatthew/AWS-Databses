271-[DF]-Lab - Performing a Conditional Search
AWS Lab: Performing a Conditional Search

This lab, titled 271-[DF]-Lab - Performing a Conditional Search, guides users through querying a relational database named world using SQL SELECT statements and WHERE clauses. The database contains three tables: city, country, and countrylanguage. The lab focuses on filtering records in the country table with various operators and functions.

Scenario

The database operations team has created a relational database called world. Your task is to assist the team by writing SQL queries to search for records in the country table using SELECT statements and WHERE clauses.

Lab Overview and Objectives

This lab demonstrates how to use the SELECT statement and WHERE clause to perform conditional searches. After completing this lab, you will be able to:





Write search conditions using the WHERE clause



Use the BETWEEN operator



Use the LIKE operator with wildcard characters



Use the AS operator to create column aliases



Use functions in SELECT statements



Use functions in WHERE clauses

Preconfigured Resources





Command Host: An Amazon EC2 instance with a database client installed



Database: world



Tables: city, country, countrylanguage

Tools and Clauses Covered





Clauses: WHERE



Operators: BETWEEN, LIKE



Functions: SUM(), LOWER()



Commands: AS

Duration

Approximately 45 minutes

Accessing the AWS Management Console





Choose Start Lab in the upper-right corner of the lab instructions.





Troubleshooting: If an Access Denied error appears, close the error box and try again.



Wait for the lab status to show a green circle next to AWS, indicating the lab is ready.



Open the AWS Management Console by selecting the green circle. This opens a new browser tab with automatic sign-in.





Tip: If the tab doesnâ€™t open, allow pop-ups in your browser settings.



Arrange the AWS Management Console tab alongside the lab instructions for easy reference.





Note: Do not change the AWS Region unless instructed.

Task 1: Connect to the Command Host

In this task, you connect to an Amazon EC2 instance (Command Host) with a database client to query the world database.





In the AWS Management Console, navigate to Services > Compute > EC2.



In the left navigation menu, select Instances.



Select the instance labeled Command Host, then choose Connect.





Note: If the Command Host is not visible, wait for the lab to finish provisioning or verify the Region.



On the Session Manager tab, choose Connect to open a terminal window.





Note: If the Connect button is unavailable, wait a few minutes and try again.



Configure the terminal by running:

sudo su
cd /home/ec2-user/





Tip: On Windows, use Shift+Ctrl+V to paste commands.



Connect to the database server with:

mysql -u root --password='re:Start19'





Reconnection Tip: If the Session Manager window is unresponsive, close it, reconnect via Session Manager, and rerun the above commands.

Task 2: Query the World Database

In this task, you write SQL queries to explore the world database using SELECT statements, WHERE clauses, and functions.





Show Available Databases
Verify the world database exists by running:

SHOW DATABASES;





If world is not listed, contact your instructor.



Review the Country Table
Examine the schema, data, and row count of the country table:

SELECT * FROM world.country;



Filter Records with WHERE and AND
Reduce the result set by filtering countries with populations between 50 million and 100 million:

SELECT Name, Capital, Region, SurfaceArea, Population
FROM world.country
WHERE Population >= 50000000 AND Population <= 100000000;



Use the BETWEEN Operator
Rewrite the previous query using BETWEEN for readability:

SELECT Name, Capital, Region, SurfaceArea, Population
FROM world.country
WHERE Population BETWEEN 50000000 AND 100000000;





Note: BETWEEN is inclusive of the start and end values.



Use LIKE and SUM for European Countries
Calculate the total population of European countries using LIKE and SUM:

SELECT SUM(Population)
FROM world.country
WHERE Region LIKE '%Europe%';





Note: The % wildcard matches any characters before or after "Europe".



Add a Column Alias with AS
Enhance the previous query with a column alias for better readability:

SELECT SUM(Population) AS "Europe Population Total"
FROM world.country
WHERE Region LIKE '%Europe%';



Case-Sensitive Search with LOWER
Perform a case-insensitive search for regions containing "central":

SELECT Name, Capital, Region, SurfaceArea, Population
FROM world.country
WHERE LOWER(Region) LIKE '%central%';





Note: SQL is generally case-insensitive, but database collation may enforce case sensitivity. Using LOWER ensures consistent comparison.

Challenge

Write a query to calculate the sum of the surface area and population for countries in North America.

Steps:





Query the country table to identify relevant columns (SurfaceArea, Population, Region).



Use SUM() to aggregate SurfaceArea and Population.



Filter for North America using LIKE or an exact match for Region.

Example Solution:

SELECT SUM(SurfaceArea) AS "North America Surface Area Total",
       SUM(Population) AS "North America Population Total"
FROM world.country
WHERE Region LIKE '%North America%';

Ending the Lab

Wait for the Ended AWS Lab Successfully message.
